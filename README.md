Statistical report done over the data set "Wine Quality Dataset".

The Wine Quality Dataset records, for different samples of white (winequality-white.csv)
and red wine (winequality-red.csv), the following variables:
1. fixed acidity = mass concentration of tartaric acid (g=dm3)
2. volatile acidity = mass concentration of acetic acid (g=dm3)
3. mass concentration of citric acid (g=dm3)
4. residual sugar mass concentration (g=dm3)
5. mass concentration of sodium chloride (g=dm3)
6. mass concentration of free sulfur dioxide (mg=dm3)
7. mass concentration of sulfur dioxide total (mg=dm3)
8. density (g=cm3)
9. pH value
10. mass concentration of potassium sulphate (mg=dm3)
11. alcohol content (vol%)

and additionally, a median sensory preference from up to three sensory assessors
(\sommeliers" in the scenario) following blind sensory assessment on a subjective
scale of 0 (disgusting) to 10 (excellent).

The main task was to complete a report for a fictional fodd AI-Start up (the final report correspond to the "Wine dataset report" pdf), which want us to answer the following questions:

1. Can we use the sommelier/wine data to create an AI with super-human per-
formance in wine tasting?
2. Which components of wine make a wine a good wine?
3. Can the AI use the data to create the perfect wine, i.e., wine whose quality
exceeds all that we have seen?

This report is divided in several different tasks:

A2: Joint the two dataset into a single one that contains the color as a feature.
A3: Perform exploratory analysis over the new data set
A4: Conduct predictive benchmarking experiments to determine:
    (i) whether, and how well wine quality can be predicted from chemical composi-
        tion and colour;
    (ii) whether wine colour adds predictive power above chemical composition and
        vice versa, in (i).

For the purpose of this report all the code was done in python using different libraries as sklearn and numpy.
